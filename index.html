        <div class="about">
            I am a Full-stack web and android app developer and an amature badminton player

            <p>
                As a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Chitkara University, I possess a diverse set of skills that extend beyond the realm of technology. Apart from my keen interest in coding, research, web development, and android development, I also excel in badminton, boasting strong skills in the sport. As an avid badminton player, I have honed my abilities through regular practice and participation in friendly matches.
                While I haven't yet participated in formal coding competitions, I actively engage in coding communities and open-source projects, which serve as a platform for collaborative problem-solving and skill development. My team-player mentality allows me to thrive in group settings, valuing collective efforts and supporting my peers to achieve common goals.                
                With a passion for both technology and sports, I strive to strike a balance between academic excellence and extracurricular pursuits. My adaptable and versatile nature enables me to contribute effectively to various projects and challenges, whether in the realm of programming or on the badminton court.
